    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>The rules for the online Simon game are as follows: 
        Gameplay
        The player must memorize a sequence of colors and buttons that the game lights up and repeat it by pressing the buttons in the correct order. 
        Scoring
        The player receives one point for each flash of the green light and 10 points when all the lights flash at once. 
        Difficulty
        The game starts off at a steady pace, but the patterns become more complicated as the player progresses. 
        High score
        The player can try to beat their high score by completing the longest sequence without making a mistake. 
        Fail sound
        If the player doesn't complete a sequence correctly, the game will play a fail sound and show the player's score by flashing lights. 
        The Simon game is based on Atari's Touch Me arcade game from 1974, but with some differences. For example, in Touch Me, all the buttons were black and produced harsh sounds. In Simon, the tones are harmonic and resemble a trumpet fanfare</p>
